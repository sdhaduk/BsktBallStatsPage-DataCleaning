# NBA-Player-Statistics-DataCleaning

## Description
* This the code I wrote in order to clean the CSV file that I downloaded from Kaggle.
* Using the Pandas libarary, I removed unwanted columns and rows, and I replaced all NULL values in the dataset.
* After cleaning the CSV file, I exported it and used it to create an SQLite3 database for "NBA-Player-Statistics"
